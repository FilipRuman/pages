## Knowledge requirements:
You only need basic programming experience.
You don’t need to know Rust or C.
The tutorial introduces most of the needed concepts as we go.
## Additional tips
I will skip writing tests within this tutorial, but as you go, you should test code that you wrote.

Feel free to experiment! Modify the syntax, add new operators. It will help you solidify the knowledge..
