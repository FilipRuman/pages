## Knowledge requirements:
You only need basic programming experience.
No knowledge of Rust or C is assumed.
The tutorial introduces most of the needed concepts as we go.
## Additional tips
I will skip writing tests within this tutorial, but as you go you should test code that you wrote
Feel free to experiment! Modify the syntax, add new operators. it will help you to solidify the knowledge.
